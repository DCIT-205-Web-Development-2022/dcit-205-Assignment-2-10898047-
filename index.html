	<h1 class="tittle">Myself</h1>
 <p>
 	
I’m from a middle-class family of Sebeh, I am Sebeh Philemon Nyarko. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a respectable farmer in our community. My mother is a retired teacher. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.

I am dark in complexion.i am 180cm tall with nice hair and a brown eye.

In compare to studies, I am good at sports.  I am the best football player at my school. Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics. I am in expert swimming. 

<span class="italics">I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk</span>. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news.

As every man have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like. While playing time, I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.

These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity I can.
